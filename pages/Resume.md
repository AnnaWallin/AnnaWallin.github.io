### What people have said about working with me...

"Anna stands out as a student of the highest caliber. It is rare to find a young person with such drive, creativity, and desire to learn. Her confidence, strong sense of self, and genuine interest in both business and personal growth make Anna a truly exceptional young person to work with. I truly believe that these traits will serve her well in her endeavors..."
-Anna's previous employer

"While completing her internship, Anna worked with clients, donors, strategic partners, and members of our womenâ€™s business resource center. She collaborated with our internal teams and also assisted us with special events, donation campaigns, social media, client features, and paid marketing initiatives. She was a fast learner who was well-suited for the quick paced and ever-changing environment of a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). During her time with us, she was adept at using communications, Excel, and Hootsuite to help us in our initiatives. Working most closely with our advancement specialist, Anna tackled everything from education and policy to marketing and donor stewardship."
- Anna's previous employer

"Anna is fearless in the face of new challenges and can work independently with vision and perseverance to ensure that the job gets done."
