Here, I have applied a linear Holt-Winters forecasting model to Norwegian car sales data found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dmi3kno/newcarsalesnorway). The data consists of sales from 2007 to the first month of 2017. I have forecasted expected sales for the year of 2016 and compared these values to actual sales.
