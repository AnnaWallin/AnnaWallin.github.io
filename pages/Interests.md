### My Interests....
While I have a background in GIS and marketing, I would be thrilled to apply my skills to a variety of industries, sectors, and roles. Consulting is of particular interest due to its fast-paced nature and focus on problem-solving while working in a team environment. In my personal life, I greatly enjoy the outdoors and making my own ice cream. I would love to contribute my skills in these sectors, but I remain open-minded and excited to learn as much as I can in the professonial world.
