## About Me...

Just having graduated from McGill University in Montreal, I looked for my next step. I found it at the University of Texas at Austin, where I am pursuing my Master of Science in Marketing. In my free-time, I like to play with my dog, Comet. He is a fifteen year old Maltese with a spunky personality. I am also passionate about the outdoors and actually went on a 30 day dog-sledding and cross-country skiing expedition in the Boundary Waters. During two different summer breaks, I visited Big Bend for hiking trips and am hoping to one day visit Banff. I also enjoy sailing and kayaking. When I was younger, I sailed mostly Turnabouts but have also sailed some larger boats. Additionally, I love to try different ice cream flavors and brands and also make my own.
