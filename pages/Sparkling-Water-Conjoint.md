### What is conjoint analysis? 
Conjoint analysis is a helpful tool to indirectly analyze consumer preferences. Essentially, which product attributes hold the most weight to consumers? 

### Project scope
For this project, our team examined sparkling water preferences. The attributes we examined were: flavor, packaging, sweetness, and price. We sent out a survey and analyzed responses.

**Attribute levels are as follows:**
Flavors: Mango, lemon, cherry
Packaging: Plastic bottle, metal can, glass bottle
Sweetness: Sugar-free, sweetened
Prices: $1.50, $3.00, $4.00

### Preferences for a single respondent
Here we have an anonymous respondent, P. We can see that their best option would be a mango flavored, sweetened sparkling water that is packaged in a plastic bottle and sold for $1.50
