### What is conjoint analysis? 
Conjoint analysis is a helpful tool to indirectly analyze consumer preferences. Essentially, which product attributes hold the most weight to consumers? 

### Project scope
For this project, our team examined sparkling water preferences. The attributes we examined were: flavor, packaging, sweetness, and price. We sent out a survey and analyzed responses.

**Attribute levels are as follows:**
Flavors: Mango, lemon, cherry
Packaging: Plastic bottle, metal can, glass bottle
Sweetness: Sugar-free, sweetened
Prices: $1.50, $3.00, $4.00

### Preferences for a single respondent
Here we can see that respondent P values flavor the most, followed by whether or not the beverage is sweetened. Packaging plays the smallest role in their purchasing decision.

Here we have an anonymous respondent, P. We can see that their best option would be a mango flavored, sweetened sparkling water that is packaged in a plastic bottle and sold for $1.50. Their worst option would be lemon flavored sparkling water that is packaged in a glass bottle and sold for $4.00.
