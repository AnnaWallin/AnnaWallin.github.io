### What is conjoint analysis? 
Conjoint analysis is a helpful tool to indirectly analyze consumer preferences. Essentially, which product attributes hold the most weight to consumers? 

### Project scope
For this project, our team (Anna Wallin, Rissa Broudy, Daniel Golden, and Mandy Hong) examined sparkling water preferences. The attributes we examined were: flavor, packaging, sweetness, and price. We sent out a survey and analyzed responses. For this project, we used Excel. The file can be found below.
