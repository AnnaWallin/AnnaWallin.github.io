This project uses the Framingham Heart Study data found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset). I model the probability of an individual becoming at risk for coronary heart disease over a ten year period. R was used. If you would like to see the code, please go to my GitHub repository: [LogisticRegression_CoronaryHeartDisease](https://github.com/AnnaWallin/LogisticRegression_CoronaryHeartDisease).
