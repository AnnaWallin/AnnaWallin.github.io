<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Anna Rosemarie Wallin, and I am currently a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). I will be completing my Master of Science in Marketing through the McCombs School of Busineess in May of 2021. Before coming to UT, I completed my undergraduate degree in Geography (Urban Systems) with a minor in Environment at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. While I am an American, the opportunity to study at McGill was a chance that I could not pass up because of its world renowned faculty, and its location in the heart of a francophone province.  As a student at McGill, I used GIS and  Python to explore spatial problems.  One GIS project that I worked on focused on finding the optimal location for a storefront in Montreal. For this project, we were given ideal target segments. I became curious how these segments were selected, which led to my interest in marketing and marketing analytics. I am able to work in the United States as an American citizen or in Canada under an Open Work Permit. This site is intended to serve as a portfolio, a place that I can show what I am working on and what interests me.
