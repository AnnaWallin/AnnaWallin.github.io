<h2 id="#intro"> 1. Introduction to Webpage </h2><br>
Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Anna Rosemarie Wallin, and I am currently a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. I will be completing my Master of Science in Marketing through McCombs in May of 2021. Before coming to UT, I completed my undergraduate degree in Geography (Urban Systems) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. While I am an American, the opportunity to study at McGill was a chance that I could not pass up. This site is intended to serve as a portfolio, a place that I can show what I am working on and what interests me.
